__What is Typescript__
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.
It is basically a superset of JavaScript, which means:

All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript adds extra features.

`WHY IT EXISTS`
JavaScript is flexible, but that flexibility can cause runtime errors in large projects.
TypeScript helps by catching errors early (at compile time).

***KEY FEATURES***
1. Static Typing
2. Better Code Quality & Readability
3. Early Error Detection
4. Object-Oriented Features
5. Compiles to JavaScript
Browsers do not run TypeScript directly.
TypeScript code is compiled (transpiled) into JavaScript.

`TYPE INFERENCING`
TypeScript automatically figures out the type of a variable, function return, or expression without you explicitly writing the type.
